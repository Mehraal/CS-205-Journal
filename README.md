# CS-205-Journal

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a driving school that would like to revolutionize the Driving exam pass rate. Their goal is to have a system built where users can sign up and review and purchase packages, take courses online, and become ready for DMV exams.

# What did you do particularly well?
I was able to gather all the requirements The DriverPass requested and also I found the missing parts of the requirements. 


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the Gannt chart and project estimation, which was a bit tight on schedule. I would study the task a little more before estimating a time to have an accurate and precise estimation.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the Gannt chart to interpret the requirements and dig deeper into each task to find out if there was a missing piece before implementing them. The user need is the most important requirement to design a system and without having accurate and sufficient information, we could waste time on unnecessary tasks that the client does not need.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
through this course, I learned the importance of the Gannt chart and how it could help to gather information and estimate the tasks, and I will use this approach in the future with the bottoms-up estimation method.
